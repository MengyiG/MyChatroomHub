### Interesting Facts About Django :guitar:

Django is named after **Django Reinhardt**, a Belgian-born Romani-French jazz musician and one of the most renowned guitar players of the 20th century. The creators of Django, **Adrian Holovaty and Jacob Kaplan-Moss**, were big fans of his music and named the framework after him as a tribute.
